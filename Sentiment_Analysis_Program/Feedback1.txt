My old TV had stopped working and I needed a new one urgently. I chose this TV because it was THE best buy. it appears to be working perfectly. I have two complaints. First the user manual is pretty useless The one thing I wanted to know was how to Change the channels, it just says the TV button can be used to change the stations without saying how Customer support treated me like an idiot but did tell me what to do. Second there is no indication of what channel It is actually at. i am used to a tv which gives me much more information about whatâ€™s going on. I cannot give it a higher rating. I am happy with it so far.
