I wa a bit worried when this TV was taken out of its box, it is very light, however it is well made and easy to set up, just plug in and play. The lightness is a boon as the unit was to be fixed to a flexible wall mount.

Picture quality is everything you could want from the spec 1080hd, but the sound is a little tinny.

I have not used any of the SMART features so cannot comment
